## Worktree Safety

Always use the primary working directory (the worktree) for all file reads and edits. Never follow absolute paths from subagent results that point to the main repo.

## Cross-Platform Support

Orca targets macOS, Linux, and Windows. Keep all platform-dependent behavior behind runtime checks:

- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Never hardcode `e.metaKey`. Use a platform check (`navigator.userAgent.includes('Mac')`) to pick `metaKey` on Mac and `ctrlKey` on Linux/Windows. Electron menu accelerators should use `CmdOrCtrl`.
- **Shortcut labels in UI**: Display `⌘` / `⇧` on Mac and `Ctrl+` / `Shift+` on other platforms.
- **File paths**: Use `path.join` or Electron/Node path utilities — never assume `/` or `\`.
